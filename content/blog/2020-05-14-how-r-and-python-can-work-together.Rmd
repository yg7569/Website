```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, fig.align = "center", warning = F, message = F,
tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60), R.options=list(max.print=100))
```

It may not come as a surprise to you that one can write Python codes in R studio. But wouldn't it be super cool if a variable created in R code chunk could also be used in Python code chunk in R studio? Believe it or not, you could actually have R and Python "communicate" with each other with the help of the reticulate package.

Now, I will show you one of the coolest tricks I have learned in my SDS 348 class at UT Austin. 

First, we can write a R code chunk that contains two strings.

```{R}
## This is a R code chunk
library(reticulate)
str1 <- "Welcome to my"
str3 <- "my first blog post."
```

Then, we can create a python code chunk with another string. To access R-defined object, we can use r.

```{python}
## This is a python code chunk
str2 = "website! This is"
print(r.str1, str2, r.str3)
```

We can also access Python-defined object uisng py$

```{R}
## This is a R code chunk
cat(c(str1, py$str2, str3))
```
