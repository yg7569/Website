        <h3>I'm <strong>{{ .Site.Params.author }}</strong>, a chemical engineering PhD student working in Dr. Jenny Jiang's lab of systems immunology at UT Austin.</h3>
        <h3>Our lab focuses on using high-throughput sequencing and single-cell analysis in combination with quantitative analysis to answer the following questions: How does the immune system develop and age? What are the molecular signatures of autoimmune diseases? Why does the immune system tolerate tumors? Answers to these questions are important in establishing metrics for immune health and providing biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy.</h3>
